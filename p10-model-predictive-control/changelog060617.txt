-> Added cubic term to 3rd degree polynomail
-> Fixed first deriviative
-> should be addition fg[2 + v_start + i]    = v_t1   - (v_t0 + a_t0 * dt) ;
-> fix fg[2 + epsi_start + i] = e_psi_t1 - ( ( psi_t0 - psides_t0) + 
                               v_t0 * delta_t0 / Lf * dt ) ;

-> Update epsi to use full derivative
-> Convert steering from radians to normalized value range
