# Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree

Learning to build the future, today.

Self-driving cars are set to change the way we live with technology on the cutting-edge of robotics, machine learning, computer vision, and mechanical engineering. In this program, I'm learning the skills and techniques used by self-driving car teams at the most innovative companies in the world.

Self-driving cars represent one of the most significant advances in modern history. Their impact will go beyond technology, beyond transportation, beyond urban planning to change our daily lives in ways we have yet to imagine.

## 01, [Find lane lines](https://github.com/swirlingsand/self-driving-car-nanodegree-nd013/tree/master/CarND-LaneLines-P1-1)
Step 1 in developing a self-driving car, automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

## 02, [Traffic sign classification](https://github.com/swirlingsand/self-driving-car-nanodegree-nd013/tree/master/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project-master)
I use what I have learnt about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I train a model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. 

## 03, [Behavioral cloning](https://github.com/swirlingsand/self-driving-car-nanodegree-nd013/tree/master/p3-behavioral-cloning-project)
Our goal is to clone human driving into a computer program using a simulator and deep neural networks. This project is part of the Udacity Self Driving Car Nano Degree program. The simulator and project guidelines are supplied by Udacity.

## 04, [Advanced lane detection](https://github.com/swirlingsand/self-driving-car-nanodegree-nd013/tree/master/p4-CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines)
Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## 05, [Car detection](https://github.com/swirlingsand/self-driving-car-nanodegree-nd013/tree/master/p5-car-detection/project)
Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier

Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.

Run my pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.

Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
